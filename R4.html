  <p> I made a pretty big die. it is made of cardboard. I put numbers as rasters and edges as vectors so that the laser printer can cut the edges<br>
      while printing a number on each side. After printed, I joined them together with glue. </p>
   <br>

   <p> Then I cut out my picture to turn it into a jigsaw puzzle. Since my Coreldraw spitted errors whenever I try to open a dxf file at it,<br>
     I had to make the scheme from the beginning on CorelDraw which was very painful. </p>

   <br>
  <p> Next, I made press fit kits using CorelDraw as well. they did fit together snuggly since I knew that the widths of indents should be the same as the<br>
      height of the cardboard, which was 1/8". I made a right triangle, a square, a pentagon, and a hexagon. Then I made the indent on each side of the polygons.<br>
      I printed 3 copies of it, so that I can actually have enough to make something out of them. And this is the result. </p>

  <p>this is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. </p>

  <p> I didn't burn it. the picture was just too complicated that it couldn't handle it. At least the flower-shaped centerpiece is printed. I'm good with that.

  <p>this is the picture I wanted to be printed on the coaster.</p>

  <br>
  <p> I made a leather strap. I think, therefore I am. It took 27 seconds to make this, and it was worth it. The letters are kinda off-centered, but<br>
    it didn't make so much difference when I put it on.</p>
