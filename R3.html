  <p> In this rotation, I made a shirt and jigsaw puzzle. </p>

  <p> I printed 08:46 on my shirt. Since the day before I made this was 9:11, I wanted to make something represents that tragedy. <br>
   8:46 AM is  when the first plane hit the world trade center. </p>
  <br>
  <strong><p> Procedure </p></strong>
  <br>
  <p> I first downloaded and installed a font that matched the theme and then typed 08:46 in illustrator, saved as JPG. <br>
    After, I opened PDIP, uploaded the JPG file, converted it as ar3 so that I can actually print it on my shirt. <br>
   It was printed, then sadly I did not know I was not supposed to touch it, so it got smeared a little bit. <br>
    It wasn't a big deal except I could notice that in a close distance. </p>

  <br>
  <p> I also made a jigsaw puzzle. I made a 12" x 12" jigsaw puzzle scheme in Fusion 360 with a bunch of bezier curves.<br>
    it was relatively easier than other projects except that my CorelDraw has "unrecoverable error" whenever I try to open the file.</p>
