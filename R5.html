  <strong><p> Rules and Limiations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers </p></strong>
  <br>
 <p> First, it shouldn't be too small. if your model or some parts of your model are too small for the printer to handle,<br>
     your printer will be covered in so many supports or fail to print it at all. Second, your model can't have more than one <br>
     material if you are using the MakerBot Replicator. Third, almost every additive manufacturing machine can't build a model <br>
     without layers. In other words, your model will have layers and you should smooth them after you print it. </p>
