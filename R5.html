  <strong><p> Rules and Limiations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers </p></strong>
  <br>
 <p> First, it shouldn't be too small. if your model or some parts of your model are too small for the printer to handle,<br>
     your printer will be covered in so many supports or fail to print it at all. Second, your model can't have more than one <br>
     material if you are using the MakerBot Replicator. Third, almost every additive manufacturing machine can't build a model <br>
     without layers. In other words, your model will have layers and you should smooth them after you print it. </p>

  <strong><p> 3D object that could not be made subtractively. </p></strong>
  <br>
  <p> I made a box in a box. The 3D model you want to make it substractively shouldn't have the inside that is bigger<br>
      than the entrance. Also, It's impossible to carve inside that is completely surrounded without damaging the outside.<br>
    So I made this.</p>

  <strong><p> Drip irrigation </p></strong>
  <br>
  <p> I measured the dimension of a hole of a water bottle, and made a 3D model of a cone-shaped rip irrigation top with threads so<br>
    that It can fit the hole.</p>
