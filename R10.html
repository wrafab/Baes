  <p> This is my final project. The LED fan clock using Arduino Nano instead. I haven't finished it yet, but I will.
      </p>
  <br>
  <p> I used Arduino nano, a breadboard, a transistor, a bunch of resistors, a D/C motor, a lithium ion battery,<br>
      LEDs, and an Opto Sensor. Also, I'm going to 3D model a case for it, and put it on my clock.</p>
  <br>
  <p> I have spent about 3 hours so far, and I might have to spend couple more hours to finish it. Since the<br>
      instruction is unclear, I had to see the circuit diagram for this. </p>
  <br>
  <p> I downloaded a Youtuber's program for Arduino to save time. But I couldn't finish it on time. </p>
  <br>
  <p> I learned that you should decide what to do quite early if you want to do something big and complicated. <br>
      I also learned that there are many unexpected situations even though the instructions are given. The one <br>
      thing I should have done was to spend more time on doing it, but the exam week was way more busy than I thought.
