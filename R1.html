  <strong> <p> Marble Challenge </p> </strong>
  <br>
 
  <br>
  <p> we and other groups were given marbles along with paper, tape, straws, paper clips, and scissors.<br>
      Our challenge was to make a single pathway using given materials for a marble to land on a certain <br>
      spot. Longer the distance, higher the score, but if the marble couldn't land on the spot, it was <br>
      disqualified.</p>
      <br>
  <p> So our group made one long and thin paper pathway for the marble. We had the longest pathway among<br>
      the groups, but it was too unstable. I knew we were going to be disqualified, and we were. However,<br>
      no one ever made their marbles land on the spot, so it didn't matter regardless. </p>
      <br>
  <p> Maybe if I had one more chance to do this challenge, I would more focus on making more stable and<br>
      precise path so that I can actually land on the spot </p>
      <br>
   <strong> <p> Marshmallow Challenge </p> </strong>
   <br>
   <p> I already knew about this challenge. I saw two groups(adults and kids) doing this challenge and the<br>
       kids group winning on Youtube. Still, that didn't mean I knew how to make the highest tower possible,<br>
       but I could at least give it a try. As kids in the video did, we started building ours by randomly <br>
       sticking noodles in it while other groups(especially senior groups) worked with their architectural <br>
       theories. Well, we won. </p>
