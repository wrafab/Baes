<h1> Rotation 9: Raspberry Pi </h1>

  <p> I quite liked my Raspberry Pi experience. I see so much potential from it. It is small, versatile, and cheap. <br>
      I learned a bit about physical computing. You have to manipulate both software and hardware in order to do that. <br>
      Raspberry Pi is nothing but a small silicon lump without OS or programs. Scratch and Python can actually tell it <br>
      what to do and how to do. I haven't done any Raspberry Pi project yet, but I feel like I want to do the LED fan clock.<br>
