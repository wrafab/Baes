  <p>I decided to use the laser printer to decorate my skateboard. At first, I tried to etch complex patterns, but<br>
     it took too much time to print, so I put three simple, geometric symbols on it. It looked modern enough.</p>

  <p>Then, my partner and I worked together to laminate them together. My partner poured glue on each piece, and I<br>
     spread it evenly, and stacked them over another. It had to be done in 8 minutes since the glue dries really fast.</p>
  <br>
 <p>After that, I put my skateboard in a vaccum bag and pulled all the air out. It took a day for my skateboared <br>
   to be shaped in a right way.</p>
