  <p> I cut three stickers using the Roland GS-24. At first I tried to turn famous quotes into stickers, but I realized<br>
      cutting out small letters without tearing them off was a painful process. That's why I made ones with simple shapes. </p>

  <p> I also printed out two full-color contour stickers of Chef Ramsay and random dice. Please don't ask me why I picked those. <br>
      I picked those two pictures, then cut them out to circles in CorelDraw. Using Contour tool, I outlined the boundaries for <br>
    the printer. </p>

  <p> I mixed two mysterious substances to make urethane. I mixed them well and let it sit for a day. The next day, since I could<br>
      not think of any stuff to be encapsulated, so I encapsulated a random leaf. I mixed two other mysterious substances as well<br>
      to make epoxy. The leaf was floating on the epoxy, so I had to press it during the whole process. The result turned out to be<br>
      alright. I'm good with this.
